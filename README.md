# Real-time 30m LPD map for SIDS

[![DOI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8c3f21-d1c6-4bc6-a75e-dbc1fd12a65b)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15276520)

This repository contains documentation and access to the Real-time 30m LPD map for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), a Google Earth Engine application engineered to facilitate the generation of Land Productivity Dynamics (LPD) maps for 40 SIDS. Accurate assessment of LPD is fundamental for monitoring progress towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3.1 and fulfilling reporting obligations under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). While high spatial resolution data are essential for characterising the heterogeneous landscapes of SIDS, their utilisation is frequently hampered by persistent cloud cover and data gaps, particularly those arising from the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure. To overcome these limitations, the application leverages a harmonised Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series at 30m spatial resolution spanning from 2000 to 2023. This robust input dataset is generated by integrating Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 scenes, USGS 32-day NDVI composites, and synthetic imagery from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm, employing advanced techniques for spatial averaging, temporal interpolation, and outlier suppression to ensure comprehensive and reliable coverage.

The application implements version 2 of the Food and Agriculture Organization-World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (FAO-WOCAT) LPD Algorithm, incorporating several key modifications to enhance its applicability and accuracy within SIDS contexts. These refinements include calculating the Mean Trend of the Integrated Difference (MTID) using the mean of the final three years to minimise outlier influence, introducing a distinct neutral category for MTID, determining initial and final 'State' based on the average of the first and last four years with biologically significant thresholds, and utilising a multi-product water mask for precise exclusion of water bodies. This collaborative development between [Apacheta](https://www.apacheta.org/), [Conservation International](https://www.conservation.org/) (CI),  and the [Partnership Initiative for Sustainable Land Management](https://pislmsids.org/) (PISLM) provides users with the capability to generate LPD maps in real-time using either default or customised parameters, offering a powerful tool to support evidence-based sustainable land management and reporting for SDG 15.3.1 in SIDS.
